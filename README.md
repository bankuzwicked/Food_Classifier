# Foods-Around-the-World 🍕🍣🍜

This project demonstrates image classification using Hugging Face's **HuggingPics** and **Vision Transformers (ViT)** to identify various food items from around the world.

The model is trained on a small, demo dataset of popular food types (e.g., pizza, noodles, burger, ravioli, sushi). It was created as a proof-of-concept and can be extended further for broader classification tasks.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Built with HuggingPics 🤗🖼 on top of **Transformers** and **PyTorch Lightning**
- Automatically gathers ~150 images per class from the web
- Fine-tunes `google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k` for food classification
- Uses Hugging Face Hub for model hosting and inference
- Includes visualization tools and metrics logging

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Only a few food classes are included for demonstration purposes.
- Some images may be noisy or irrelevant due to the nature of web scraping.
- This model is **not production-ready** and is intended for educational/demonstration use.

---

## 📊 Metrics

**Validation Accuracy**: ~88.3% on the small test split  
(Metrics may vary slightly across runs due to randomness in sampling.)
